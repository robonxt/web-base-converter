# Number Converter PWA

A lightweight, dependency-free Base Converter PWA for converting between number systems (Binary, Octal, Decimal, Hexadecimal).


## What is a Base Converter?

A base converter is a tool that transforms numbers from one number system to another. Number systems, or numeral systems, are ways to represent numbers using a specific set of symbols. The most common number system is decimal (base 10), which uses 10 digits (0-9). Other common systems include:

- **Binary (Base 2)**: Uses only 0 and 1
- **Octal (Base 8)**: Uses digits 0-7
- **Hexadecimal (Base 16)**: Uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F

For example, the decimal number 42 is represented as:
- 101010 in binary
- 52 in octal
- 2A in hexadecimal

Base converters are essential tools in computer science, digital electronics, programming, and other technical fields where different number representations are frequently used.
